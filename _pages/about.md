I am currently an undergraduate student in The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. My major is Data Science and Big Data Technology and my major coursework involves mathematics, statistics, machine learning and programming. 

From my perspective, the undergraduate learning stage should primarily emphasize breadth. My future research and career interest falls on the machine learning domain. Therefore, I endeavored to explore several mainstream research directions within the field of machine learning, aiming to identify the most fitting specialization for me. I have participated three interenships, which involves data analytics, data engineering, and algorithms. I explored the Natural Language Processing (NLP) during my internship at Tencent, where I contributed to the reinforcement of its flagship Large Language Model (LLM) in terms of RLHF. 

I started another research project at the beginning of 2024, which is about subgraph searching via GNN. The general motivation is that the GNN methods are much faster than the current methods for subgraph searching (classical graph database approaches). I plan to complete the final paper of this research in June 2024.

My main purpose of building this website is to display my academic progress, CV and my finished projects in an efficient way. You can visit other parts through the menu bar above the page. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested!
